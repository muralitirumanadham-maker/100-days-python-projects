# Day 03 — Treasure Island Adventure Game 🏝️

## Project Description

Treasure Island is a text-based adventure game built using Python. The player makes a series of choices to navigate through different scenarios in order to find hidden treasure. The project focuses on decision-making logic using conditional statements and logical operators.

## Features ✨

* Interactive story-based gameplay
* Multiple decision paths and outcomes
* ASCII art game introduction
* Nested conditional logic
* Case-insensitive user input handling

## Technologies Used

* Python 3

## Concepts Learned 📚

* Control Flow using if / else statements
* Conditional operators
* Modulo operator basics
* Nested if and elif statements
* Multiple if conditions in succession
* Logical operators (and, or, not)
* User input handling
* String methods (.lower())

## How to Run 🚀

1. Install Python on your system.
2. Run the program using:

```python
python treasure_island.py
```

## Example Gameplay

```
Welcome to Treasure Island
Your mission is to find the treasure.

You're at a cross road.

You have come to a lake.
Type 'wait' or 'swim': wait

There is a house with 3 doors.
Choose red, yellow or blue: yellow

You win!!! You found the treasure!
```

## Learning Outcomes 🎯

This project improved understanding of randomness, list indexing, and conditional logic while building an interactive command-line game.
