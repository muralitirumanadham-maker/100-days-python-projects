# Day 02 — Tip Calculator 💰

## Project Description

A Python command-line application that calculates how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including a selected tip percentage. This project focuses on Python data types, type conversion, mathematical operations, and formatted output.

## Features ✨

* Accepts total bill amount from the user
* Calculates tip percentage dynamically
* Splits the bill equally among people
* Displays formatted monetary output

## Technologies Used

* Python 3

## Concepts Learned 📚

* Python primitive data types (int, float, string)
* Type checking and type conversion
* Mathematical operations in Python
* User input handling
* Number manipulation
* f-string formatting

## How to Run 🚀

1. Install Python.
2. Run the program:

```id="x08d91"
python tip_calculator.py
```

## Example Output

```id="m3bss0"
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $150
How much tip would you like to give? 10,12, or 15? 12

## Learning Outcomes 🎯

This project improved understanding of randomness, list indexing, and conditional logic while building an interactive command-line game.
