# Day 04 — Rock Paper Scissors Game ✊📄✂️

## Project Description

Rock Paper Scissors is a Python command-line game where the user competes against the computer. The computer makes random choices using Python’s random module while the player selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The game includes input validation, replay functionality, and ASCII art visuals for an interactive experience.

## Features ✨

* Computer opponent powered by random choice generation
* ASCII art representation for Rock, Paper, and Scissors
* Input validation for incorrect selections
* Continuous gameplay with replay option
* Clear win, lose, and draw result handling

## Technologies Used

* Python 3

## Concepts Learned 📚

* Python random module
* Lists and list indexing
* Offset and accessing list elements
* Appending and managing list data
* Handling IndexError situations
* Nested conditional statements
* While loops for repeated gameplay
* User input validation

## How to Run 🚀

1. Install Python on your system.
2. Run the program:

```python id="6g8k8y"
python rock_paper_scissors.py
```

## Example Gameplay

```id="5u9bkk"
Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, 2 for Scissors: 0

You chose:
(rock ASCII art)

Computer chose:
(scissors ASCII art)

You Win 🎉

Play again? Type 'yes': yes
```

## Learning Outcomes 🎯

This project improved understanding of randomness, list indexing, and conditional logic while building an interactive command-line game.
